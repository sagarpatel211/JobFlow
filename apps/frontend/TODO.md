The AI should be designed to queue applications when the "Fill" button is clicked, rather than applying immediately. This ensures that applications are only submitted to major companies, allowing me to quickly skim through them and decide which ones to finalize. The system should automatically add a new row in the applications page with a "Queued" tag, making it easy to review and submit later with a polished resume and cover letter. Additionally, it should record all actions by screen recording and attaching the footage to each application, providing a transparent history of how the process works.

To efficiently manage the job tracker, which will contain up to 10,000 listings, stale postings should disappear while important ones remain at the top, sorted by LinkedIn followers. However, managing such a large volume of jobs still poses a challenge. The AI should explore advanced filtering techniques to avoid manual sorting. A possible solution is an auto-archive setting for jobs older than five days, but this alone may not be sufficient. While auto-deleting listings after 30 days could help, it poses a riskâ€”some employers might reach out months later, making it crucial to retain relevant postings. A better approach needs to be developed, possibly involving an intelligent archiving system that prioritizes important opportunities without excessive clutter.

Lastly, ask llm for additional features on the application page, helping refine the system further to improve efficiency and usability.
