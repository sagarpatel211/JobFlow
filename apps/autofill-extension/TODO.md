- Add a homepage for the chrome extension with a queue to show what is going to be applied for
- Add a feature where it archives the submitted application and a recording of the application process
- Add a loading icon when we start the autofill process and when we are done with status updates
- Possibly emails the user when the application is submitted with a link to the package
- The queue should be able to be set from the frontend so it will show on the extension with an API

- fix scripts for backend for chrome extension so it is automated

- Add this to auto apply!! https://chatgpt.com/c/67b9492b-ba24-8011-8749-860df34646f1

- figure out how to apply when the job posting is like a workday link that requires signing in

//   I need to be able to have a queue of applying for jobs
//    but i need to be able to fill out current tab form with a
//    button so it should mention that on the button and

// instead of putting the status in the queue, have a current
// status box which shows what the current work is being done
// and use https://ui.aceternity.com/components/multi-step-loader
// and make sure if we automate 10 mill jobs, we need pagination or
// we need to make sure that it clears regularly so we avoid too
// many listed for the user or we just show the top 5 and have the queue shown on the applications page on jobflow

// clicking fill with ai should add to queue first and then fill out the form
// and then remove from queue, cuz it needs to track on jobflow and progress. or we can have a toggle that says don't track on jobflow

// ADD A SECTION THAT SAYS "UPDATE PERSONAL INFO" ON JOBFLOW TO REFLLECT THE CURRENT INFO ON THE EXTENSION. ADD A TOGGLE TO CREATE NEW RESUME AND COVER LETTER. PLAN HOW THE ENTIRE PROCESS WILL WORK CUZ IF IT UPDATES WILL WE CREATE A NEW RESUME WHEN AUTOAPPLYING? HOW CAN THE USER MAKE SURE THE RESUME IS GOOD, ETC.
