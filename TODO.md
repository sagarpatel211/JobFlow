- add the loading skeleton to only fix the table cuz it keeps flashing on each change which sucks when most components should stay the same only table content should change (do this today)
- ask gpt for more functionality for this entire job tracker page to make me more productive


Fixes To Do:
- [ ] The archived jobs should not show up as part of the charts

Also in the apppopover.tsx, we should add a Personal notes section for multi line text. Also in the apppopover.tsx we should be able to add jobs to folders be able to put jobs in folders. Then there should be a section either below the table or a new window where we can see jobs for folders and tags so design this component well so it is useful.

ask gpt what features we would need to make this tracker more efficient


- make the search bar more advanced, it should not just show job rows but have a column for personal info sections
- and suggested results and then the left side is also job rows cuz we might want to search for previous interview questions or something. make this more advanced where we keep previous technicals and links and stuff

- add folder and tags sections


- we should be able to add folder section since we might want to add jobs based on summer 2025 or something

-set up elasticsearch and blob storage
